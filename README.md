# All Seeing Octo
Autonomous Mapping via Sonar

Using an Arduino Uno, a Propeller ActivtyBot Kit, and some servo motors; I created a simple robot that can autonomously scan a 
room and identify all the obstacles that exist and how the room generally looks like.

The code was written in the Arduino Language, but I will update it to C++.

There were some issues with the code when I was working on it, and I hope that maybe we can solve those issues as well, once I 
push it later.

I hope to use this to develop a sort of Wayfinding mechanism for the disabled to navigate a room.


Here is a picture of the All Seeing Octo(need a better name)

Please excuse the spaghetti around the robot.

This is still a work in progress, please enjoy!
